# About

SONG expects submitter IDs submitted (for samples, specimens and patients) by clinicians to be mapped to the internal system IDs of a system via an external service that it calls.

This service fulfills that contract for the Clin project, by doing lookups in the Patient index of Clin's Elasticsearch database.
